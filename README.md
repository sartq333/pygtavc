trying to automate gta vice city via python. this project is majorly going to be the reimplementation of this series by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeETZEOy4VdocT7TOjfSA8a), although some modifications are there since i'm doing this project on ubuntu :). 

i was also thinking to intergrate the with some vlm and kind of like we would feed in the image (along with a prompt, lets say: "grab the nearest car which comes in your sight and start driving it for sometime.") to the vlm and then that vlm would decide what key it should press. but since the inference speed of current vlms is painfully slow as compared to the speed in which we need the commands to run the game, this seems impossible at the moment, if anyone has any suggestions regarding it, please feel free to reach out to me via [twitter](https://x.com/sartq_3). i tried out moondream on a screen shot of the game and it took ~370 seconds to respond, you can check the google colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rRkzxF-d3dWJSCqAdbWd9cY48eb-oyM2?usp=sharing).

i'll also try to document the journey of this project:
